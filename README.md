# tsoha-quizzer

tsoha-quizzer is an application that allows users to partake in weekly quizzes. A single quiz consists of 1 to n question/answer pairs. A player can't partake in a given quiz more than once. The score of a player is saved, and under every quiz the top 10 scorers are shown. A top 25 all-time scorers page allows the users to view the all-time ranking.

The application has two types of users â€“ players and admins.

- Currently a user can take part in the same quiz multiple times. This should not be possible according to the original specificaitons.
